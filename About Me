Hi all, my name is Justin and welcome to my repo. I am from Columbus, Ohio and am looking forward to starting a career in Data Science.

The way I understand data science is a way of compiling data and interpreting the results in different ways and perspectives. 
I have worked in pharmaceutical research the last 2 years and data interpretation plays a large role in this business. 
Research results are buried in data and finding the significance of specific data points and how they interact can make or break the entire research study.
